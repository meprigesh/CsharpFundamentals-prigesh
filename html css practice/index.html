        Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a
        topic sentence.

        Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific
        main point. Whereas the thesis is the
        main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a
        topic sentence has a unifying function.
        But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the
        paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph
        is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In
        particular, opening and closing paragraphs,
        which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.

        In academic writing, the topic sentence nearly always works best at the beginning of a paragraph so that the
        reader knows what to expect:
        How do I develop my ideas in a paragraph?
        Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence through an ordered, logical progression
        of ideas. There are a number of useful techniques
        for expanding on topic sentences and developing your ideas in a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports
        a general statement by means of examples, details,
        or relevant quotations (with your comments).

        In Harry’s world fate works not only through powers and objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands, and
        the Goblet of Fire, but also through people.
        Repeatedly, other characters decide Harry’s future for him, depriving him of freedom and choice. For example,
        before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control Harry’s
        life, keeping from him knowledge of his past and understanding of his identity (Sorcerer’s 49). In Harry Potter
        and the Chamber of Secrets, Dobby repeatedly assumes
        control over events by intercepting Ron’s and Hermione’s letters during the summer; by sealing the barrier to
        Platform 93⁄4, causing Harry to miss the Hogwarts Express;
        and by sending a Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match, breaking his wrist. Yet again, in Harry Potter and
        the Prisoner of Azkaban, many adults intercede
        while attempting to protect Harry from perceived danger, as Snape observes: “Everyone from the Minister of Magic
        downward has been trying to keep famous Harry
        Potter safe from Sirius Black” (284). All these characters, as enactors of fate, unknowingly drive Harry toward
        his destiny by attempting to control or to direct his
        life, while themselves controlled and directed by fate.
